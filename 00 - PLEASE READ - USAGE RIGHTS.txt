Usage Rights:

Anyone who chooses to do so has my permission to create and sell armor or blasters based on my work, for profit.

I ask that you not sell the 3D files themselves, but printing and selling items, or selling items cast from molds made from printed files is perfectly acceptable.

There are a few rules though:

1. Price the items fairly. Let's try not to exploit members of our own fandom.

2. Produce quality items. I mean, in a roundabout way, these things do have my name on them. I don't want to be associated with shoddy workmanship. I’d actually love it if you’d send me a sample

3. Serve your customers well. Set realistic expectations up front, and meet or exceed those expectations. And if you make a mistake, over correct. Again, I don't want my name to be associated in any way with a poor buying experience.

4. If you profit from my work, I highly encourage you to take a portion of that profit and do something good in the world with it. Donate to charity. Buy a homeless guy a sandwich. Adopt a shelter dog. It doesn't matter what it is. Follow your heart.



That's it. Go forth and do good.
